# angular1-ES6-jspm-gulp

Don't panic - not yet another Angular seed project.

This is just a sandpit for me primarily. I wanted to start a new Angular 1.* project using typescript and ES6 modules - and after much faffing around settled on jspm and gulp for the build process. 

There are not a lot of examples yet of this combination, so putting her in case it is of use to anyone else.
